                <h3>New Horizons in the Yamatai Controversy Opened by Science</h3>
                <p class="summary">
                    A revolutionary demonstration breaking over 100 years of stagnation in the debate. While generally read as "Yamatai-koku," recent research reveals this is a later misreading. This paper analyzes "Yamaichi-koku," found in the oldest manuscripts, using a "3rd-century Phonological Shift Model." The results demonstrate that <strong>the stop sound contained in "Ichi" (壹) is the only phonologically rational transcription that accurately captures the sound of "Yamato" (Mountain Gate) in Kyushu at that time. Conversely, "Tai" (臺) does not phonologically hold up as a transcription of "Yamato" given 3rd-century phonology (sounds closer to "la" or "dwe"). This paper strongly supports the theory that Yamaichi-koku was located in Yamato (Yamon), Kyushu.</strong>

                <h2>The First Emperor Was a Chemist</h2>
                <h3>Deciphering the 1,300-Year Mystery of "Musui-zo-ame" in <i>Nihon Shoki</i></h3>
                <p class="summary">
                    The surprising truth of scientific technology hidden within Japan's founding mythology. The strange ritual of "Musui-zo-ame" (Waterless Candy Making) performed by the first Emperor, Jimmu, was not a myth but an "encrypted technical manual" describing a sophisticated chemical process for refining mercury (a strategic material) from cinnabar. By utilizing lead isotope analysis and archaeological science, this paper presents a new historical image overturning the origins of Japan, suggesting the Yamato sovereignty was built on technological hegemony rather than mere military force.

                <p class="summary">
                    A web tool developed during the research for the paper "Phonological Analysis of the Yamaichi-koku Notation." By inputting kanji, you can play and compare Old Chinese pronunciations based on multiple reconstruction systems (Starostin, Baxter, Zhengzhang, etc.). This tool is released to help confirm the actual acoustic differences between "Ichi" (壹) and "Tai" (臺) and to explore the reality of the "sounds" heard by ancient scribes.

                <strong>About: Masahiro Miyazaki</strong><br>
                Independent Ancient History Researcher. Operating freely outside of university or institutional affiliations, he cuts into history controversies that have been deadlocked for over a century using scientific methods. He sheds new light on Japan's origins through unique cross-disciplinary approaches, such as re-analyzing the <i>Gishi Wajinden</i> via phonology and deciphering ancient rituals as chemical processes.
